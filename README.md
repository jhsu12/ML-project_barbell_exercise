# ML-project_barbell_exercise

This project is based on the tutorial of [Dave Ebbelaar](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-Y17yukoyy0sT2hoSQxn1TdV0J7-MX4K&si=z8SJ44VOSEUxseyR). 

# Goal 
Create Python scripts to process, visualize, and model accelerometer and gyroscope data to create a machine learning model that can classify barbell exercises and count repetitions.

# Project overview 
Part 1 — Introduction, goal, quantified self, MetaMotion sensor, dataset

Part 3 — Visualizing data, plotting time series data
Part 4 — Outlier detection, Chauvenet’s criterion, local outlier factor
Part 5 — Feature engineering, frequency, low pass filter, PCA, clustering
Part 6 — Predictive modelling, Naive Bayes, SVMs, random forest, neural network
Part 7 — Counting repetitions, creating a custom algorithm
